# Music-Store-Analysis
I put together this repository to share a SQL dataset from a music store, along with some queries I wrote to explore the data and answer fun questions along the way.

Which music genres are the most popular?

Who are the top-selling or most listened-to artists?

Which songs are fan favorites or bestsellers?

What’s the average price for each type of music?

Which countries lead in music purchases?

Overall, the project effectively answered key questions about the store’s business performance. These insights can help guide smarter decisions around marketing strategies and product offerings moving forward.
